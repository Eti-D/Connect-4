The following programs will be personal projects that try to help me gain an understanding of programing, algorithms and scalable projects,

Connect_4 is a well known and basic game, in my project i have tried to use as little brute force or static functions. My main goal is to provide the fewest amount of instructions so that the project is functional and scalable.

Connect_4 will be easily scaled to a higher dimensional game simply by changing the dimensions of the array and adding the new directions of movement
